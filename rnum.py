1. What does the random.randint(1, 50) function do?
The random.randint(1, 50) function generates a random integer between 1 and 50, inclusive. This means the function can return any integer value from 1 to 50, and each number has an equal chance of being selected. This is used to determine the secret number that the player will try to guess.

2. Explain the purpose of the while True loop.
The while True loop is used to create an infinite loop that continues to prompt the player for a guess until the correct number is guessed. The loop will keep executing its block of code until it encounters a break statement, which will exit the loop. This ensures that the player can make multiple guesses until they succeed in finding the correct number.

3. How does the try-except block handle invalid input?
The try-except block is used to handle potential errors that might occur when converting the player's input to an integer. Here's how it works:

try block: The code inside the try block attempts to execute guess = int(input("Enter your guess (1-50): ")), which reads the player's input and converts it to an integer.
except ValueError block: If the input is not a valid integer (e.g., if the player types a string like "abc" or a float like "3.14"), a ValueError exception is raised. The except block catches this exception and prints an error message ("Invalid input. Please enter a valid number."), preventing the program from crashing.
4. How does the game determine if the guess is too low or too high?
After ensuring that the guess is within the valid range (1-50), the game compares the player's guess to the secret number:

If guess < secret_number: The guess is too low, and the game prints "Your guess is too low."
If guess > secret_number: The guess is too high, and the game prints "Your guess is too high."
If guess == secret_number: The guess is correct, and the game prints "Congratulations! You guessed the correct number."
5. What condition causes the loop to break and end the game?
The loop breaks and ends the game when the player guesses the correct number. This condition is checked with if guess == secret_number. If this condition is true, the game congratulates the player with "Congratulations! You guessed the correct number." and then executes the break statement, which exits the while True loop, thereby ending the game.

Here's the relevant part of the code for context:

python
Copy code
if guess < secret_number:
    print("Your guess is too low.")
elif guess > secret_number:
    print("Your guess is too high.")
else:
    print("Congratulations! You guessed the correct number.")
    break
This ensures that the game continues until the player makes a correct guess, at which point the loop terminates.
